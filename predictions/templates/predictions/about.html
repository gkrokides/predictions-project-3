                <h2>Black Model</h2>
                <p>You will also see this as <strong>ELO(H)</strong>. This model uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating</a> system as its base but with
                a number of modifications. It incorporates variables that make it much stronger when applied in football, i.e  HGA (home ground advantage), Goal difference
                scaling factors, draw thresholds and more. The (H) in parenthesis stands for 'Historical' and indicates the lookback period that the model considers when making predictions.
                This means that the model goes back and gathers info for all the games of each team for the current season.

                <h2>Maroon Model</h2>
                <p>You will also see this as <strong>ELO(6)</strong>. The base of the calculations in this model is the same as the black model (ELO(H)) with the difference being in the lookback
                period. So the (6) in the name of the model means that the data gathered for the calculation of predictions are going back 6 games. So this model tries to capture the most recent
                form and ignores the build up of the team's form since the start of the season. So all the variable values are calculated according to the team's and season's last 6 games.</p>

                <h2>Yellow Model</h2>
                <p>You will also see this as <strong>GSRS</strong>. This model takes a totally different approach than the other two. GSRS stands for Goal Superiority Rating System. This means
                that the predictions are calculated using the goals scored and conceded, calculated as ratios for the needs of the prediction variables. Put simply, it does make use of variables such as
                Home Ground Advantage, scaling factors, draw thresholds etc like the other two models, but the basis of each team's form when calculating a prediction is the goals superiority (both for and against)
                of each team. The lookback of this model is 6 games.</p>

        <h2>Predictions & Ranking</h2> When looking at the League Overview in the <a href="{% url 'predictions' %}">predictions page</a>, you will notice that we rank the teams in a different way than what's used normally.
        So we don't give 3 points for each win and 1 point for each draw. The Elo rating system helps us rank the teams according to their real form. For example, a team that wins 3 - 0 away will get more
        points compared to winning the same opponent 1 - 0 at home. The ranking of the opponent is also taken into consideration; for example, if a weak team wins a strong team, they will get more points
        than what the strong team would get if they won.

        <h2>Dashboard</h2>The Dashboard gives you an understanding of how the models are performing in each league. It is quite impossible for the models
            to achieve high performance on all covered leagues. So the best way to take advantage of these predicting models is by using the dashboard to identify the leagues for which the models
            have high strike rate. So we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you start by looking at the <a href="{% url 'byleague' %}">Overview</a> page, filter it to show the current season,
             and identify a league with high strike rate. If you want more information on how the models are performing on that league, head over to the  <a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">Strike Rate & Winners</a>
              page and filter the dashboard to show the league you identified for the current season. Additionally, you can look at the <a href="{% url 'bygameweek' %}">Performance by Gameweek</a>, again
             filtering the dashboard for your identified league and look at how the models are performing each week against the average. To make your lives easier, the
              <a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">Strike Rate & Winners</a> and <a href="{% url 'bygameweek' %}">Performance by Gameweek</a> pages, by default show stats for the top league
             in the current season. But feel free to filter the stats according to the leagues you identified as top performers.

	Disclaimer: These models do not make use of qualitative data, meaning that they don't harvest
			data that cannot be measured objectively i.e a team missing a couple of key players or a team changing coach in the middle of the season etc. The reason we can't use this kind of data is because it's almost impossible to objectively predict how much such
			situations can affect a team at any given time. Instead, we use quantitative data such as goals scored/conceded home and away, percentage of home/away wins, etc. The models do not
			guarantee success and past performance is not indicative of future performance. We believe the best way to use these models is finding the top 3 or 4 leagues in terms of strike rate
			performance for the current season, and follow these leagues. The dashboard was created specifically for this reason, to help you find how the models are performing on each league so
			you can follow the top performing models at any given season.
