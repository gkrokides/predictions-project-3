ELO_S = 400  # S is a scaling parameter that controls the extent to which a team's Ratings deficit, net of any
# Home Ground Advantage, is translated into expected performance. Larger values of S mean that
# a team's Expected share of points scored responds more slowly to any given Ratings deficit or surplus
# net of Home Ground Advantage, while smaller values of S mean the opposite.
